# Improving the performance of VANET using Ant Queue Optimization(AQO) Scheme

Over a decade, Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETS) has been evolved and there are
lots of challenges in the present network situation out of which traffic congestion is
one. In this paper, to address this problem and also to improve the performance of
VANET in terms of capacity, size, topological changes and maintaining the shortest
routes, a new scheme Ant Queue Optimization Scheme(AQO) have been introduced in
extension of Ant Colony Optimization(ACO). The proposed Ant Queue Optimization
Scheme combines both proactive and reactive mechanisms. Unlike the ACO, the AQO
dynamically makes decision in choosing shortest best route in highly congested areas.
Route selection is dynamically at each intersection irrespective of the size of the traffic.
Experimental results shows that the performance of the AQO is better than ACO.
